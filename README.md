# AHRQ Quality Indicators CSV datasets 

## Introduction

The [AHRQ Quality Indicators (PQIs)](https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/modules/pqi_resources.aspx#techspecs) are measures  developed by the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/) to evaluate clinical outcomes with inpatient hospital administrative data. Codes relevant to the indicators are extracted from pdf files from the respective modules and merged with files from [The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CSSR) tools](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp) to create CSV files suitable for data analysis in R, Python or other statistical programs.
